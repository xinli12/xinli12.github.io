你好呀！👋 这是我在这个小小角落写下的第一篇正式 blog。没有什么宏大的主题，主要想聊聊我为什么决定搭建这个个人主页——也算是一个简单的自我介绍。

## 🎯 最直接的原因当然是申博/找工

说实话，起初动念建立个人主页其实是功利性很强的。最近我一直在准备申请博士，也在找实习，深刻意识到在这个信息爆炸的时代，如果不能清晰、个性化、有深度地展示自己，是很难被发现的。

尤其是每次提交材料时，我不想只提交一个冰冷的 CV 或者 GitHub 连接（我的GitHub项目和星星数也不多😅）。也希望有一个空间能更好地表达我是谁、我在做什么、我在想什么，而且不那么枯燥、晦涩、单调。

## ✍️ 顺便记录一点思考

当然，这个主页不仅是给别人看的，也是写给自己的。

很多时候我们在赶 deadline、读论文、找寻机会的日常中，很难停下来问自己一句："我现在做的这些，和我真正关心的问题有什么关系？" 写 blog 的过程就像是在和自己对话，逼自己把模糊的想法说清楚，把零散的经历串起来。

## 🧱 这里会写些什么？

计划写点和研究、学习、读书、项目经历相关的内容，也会偶尔插播一些比较日常的碎碎念。比如读了一篇有趣的 paper、碰到一个好用的工具，或者是某个深夜的突发奇想等等。

话题可能会比较广泛，但我希望能逐渐找到自己的节奏，并吸引到同样喜欢这些内容的人。🌟

## 🌱 希望它成为一个"持续构建"的地方

我也希望这个主页可以随着时间慢慢迭代，记录一些阶段性的痕迹，留下人生的真实轨迹。


那就先写到这里啦，  
Xin 🌻

Hello there! 👋 This is my first proper blog post in this little corner of the internet. Nothing particularly grand here—I mainly wanted to chat about why I decided to build this personal homepage, which serves as a simple introduction to myself.

## 🎯 The most direct reason is, of course, PhD applications and job hunting

To be honest, my initial motivation for creating a personal homepage was rather utilitarian. I've been preparing PhD applications recently and looking for internships, and it’s made me realise just how much we live in an age of information overload. If we can’t present yourself clearly, authentically, and with some depth—while keeping it concise—we risk getting lost in the crowd.

Particularly when submitting applications, I didn't want to just send off a cold CV or GitHub link (my GitHub projects and star count aren't particularly impressive either 😅). I wanted a space where I could better express who I am, what I'm doing, and what I'm thinking about—without being dry, obscure, or monotonous.

## ✍️ Recording some thoughts along the way

Of course, this homepage isn't just for others—it's also written for myself.

We often get so caught up in chasing deadlines, reading papers, and seeking opportunities that we rarely pause to ask ourselves: "How does what I'm doing now relate to the questions I genuinely care about?" The process of writing blog posts is like having a conversation with myself, forcing me to articulate vague ideas clearly and connect scattered experiences into a coherent narrative.

## 🧱 What will I write about here?

I plan to write about research, studying, reading, and project experiences, with the occasional more casual musings thrown in. Things like an interesting paper I've read, a useful tool I've discovered, or perhaps some late-night idea.

The topics might be quite varied, but I hope to gradually find my rhythm and attract people who enjoy similar content. 🌟

## 🌱 Hoping it becomes a place of "continuous construction"

I also hope this homepage can evolve gradually over time, documenting various phases and leaving authentic traces of life's journey.

I'll leave it there for now,  
Xin 🌻
