excerpt: "And how much do you actually believe in your own answer?"

I've noticed a distinct difference now compared to when I was an undergraduate. Back then, the people around me tended to encourage me to explore whatever I liked. If you'd asked me at the time what my long-term goal was, I probably would have given a different, superficial answer every day.

Fast forward to the present ‚è©. Suddenly, people actually do care about my long-term goals. It's a slightly sad sign that I've basically grown up and need to say farewell to my carefree university days. Now, I'm expected to be more professional and pragmatic. Relationships tend to depend more on shared goals and values. We're supposed to know who we are, become that person, and from there build stable collaborations and connections. 

Most of my university experience was driven by the enjoyment of the process rather than the results. But saying you value learning over outcomes doesn't always go down well in certain interviews--especially in industry roles, where you're expected to be clear-minded and at least somewhat *results-oriented*.

Probably because of the twists and turns in one's journey, and the complexity of today's world, figuring out a solid long-term goal hasn't been easy. But at some point, we all need to push ourselves.
