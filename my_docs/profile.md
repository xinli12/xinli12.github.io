# Hello! 👋

Welcome to my corner of GitHub! 👋 I’m a physics grad who partly turned to the dark side—machine learning. 

I'm curious about what our universe holds and what the future brings, and I'm passionate about building models—particularly those interpretable by humans—to **explore, understand, and predict** the phenomena around us.

## 🚀 What I'm Currently Working On

- 🧠 I like models that make sense.
- 🔭 I simulate the universe (sometimes just in Python).

My current focus is on applying rigorous statistical and computational methods to scientific challenges. Some of my key interests include:

- Simulation-based inference in astrophysics
- Probabilistic modelling and inference
- Time series modelling/forecasting
- Deep generative models (especially for scientific simulations)

I'm especially drawn to projects where interpretability and theoretical grounding are as important as performance.

## 📬 Let's Connect

I'm always keen to chat about interesting ideas, collaborations, or challenging problems!

- **Email**: [xinli020125@gmail.com](mailto:xinli020125@gmail.com)
- **Social Media**: I rarely post, but I scroll through [RedNote (小红书)](https://www.xiaohongshu.com/user/profile/5cc47bed000000001102a0a2) daily!
- **GitHub**: You're already here! Feel free to have a look around.
- **Ask me about**: Physics, machine learning, surviving a physics degree, when Nvidia might hit $6 trillion, or why my model refuses to converge at 2 a.m. I'm happy to chat in both English and 中文！
